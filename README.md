# MiniSHARC-Arduino
An I2C library for interfacing with the MiniDSP MiniSHARC

# UPDATE July 27, 2016
Firmware in newer MiniSHARCs no longer sends the volume status information required by this library. As such, the library is mostly defunct. See this post for technical details: https://www.minidsp.com/forum/hardware-support/12106-arduino-library-to-control-the-minisharc-using-i2c#26194
